The best bot

## Notes
The source code here is provided for educational purposes. I would recommend against running your own instance of this bot. Instead, invite it by clicking this [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=787927476177076234&permissions=2486562007&scope=bot%20applications.commands). Most moderation permission are not nesscary required if you don't plan to use this bot for moderation purposes. Slash commands are currently in test and will be introduce to bot later.

## License
**All the code inside this reposiory are open sourced and you are free to use it for different purposes, as long as you follow the license in [LICENSE](https://github.com/Cryptex-github/the-anime-bot-bot/blob/main/LICENSE).** As of right now, the code is still pretty messy, unconsitent, and maybe unefficent for legacy files. (fun.py and others.py)

## Contributing
I am open to contribution, as I said my code are not perfect so contribution are welcome. (Especially adding help to all commands)
