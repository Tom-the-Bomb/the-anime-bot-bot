The best bot

## Notes

The source code here is provided for educational purposes. I would recommend
against running your own instance of this bot. Instead, invite it by clicking
this
[link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=787927476177076234&permissions=2486562007&scope=bot%20applications.commands).
Most moderation permission are not necessarily required if you don't plan to use
this bot for moderation purposes. Slash commands are currently in pre-alpha and
will be introduced to the bot later.

## License

**All the code inside this reposiory is open sourced and you are free to use it
for different purposes, as long as you follow the license in
[LICENSE](https://github.com/Cryptex-github/the-anime-bot-bot/blob/main/LICENSE).**
As of right now, the code is still pretty messy, inconsistent, and maybe
unefficent for legacy files. (fun.py and others.py)

## Contributing

I am open to contributions, as I said my code is not perfect so contributions
are welcome. (Especially adding help to all commands)
